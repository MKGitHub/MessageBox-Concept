MessageBox Concept
------
MessageBox is a simple concept for decoupling entities. Think of it as notifications but the opposite.

* For example entity A can place a message that entity B can read whenever suitable ‚Äì not at once like notifications.
* For example a view controller would like to talk to another view controller, but you don't want to create a strong or weak relationship between them.
* This concept is highly flexible as it allows you to change which entity should put & get a message, without having to refactor your code & architecture.

Simple Example Usage
------
```swift
let messageBox = MessageBox()

// set
messageBox.setObject("TestObject1", forKey:"TestKey1")

// get
// but don't remove it, keep it stored, so that it can still be retrieved later
let someObject = messageBox.getObject(forKey:"TestKey1", removeIfFound:false)

// get
// and remove it
let someObject = messageBox.getObject(forKey:"TestKey1", removeIfFound:true)
```

How to Install
------
There is no framework/library distibution, I recommend that you simply add the `MessageBox.swift` to your project. As this will allow you to easily find & read the MessageBox API, and it will also allow MessageBox to compile using your apps build settings. 

* Using Git: `git clone https://github.com/MKGitHub/MessageBox.git` then add `MessageBox.swift` to your Xcode project.
* Manual Way: Add `MessageBox.swift` to your Xcode project.
* Using Carthage: In your Cartfile add `github "MKGitHub/MessageBox" ~> 1.2` then `carthage update --no-build` then add `MessageBox.swift` to your Xcode project.
* Using Swift Package Manager: swift-tools-version:4.0
* CocoaPods support has been removed! üôåüôèüéâ Never use CocoaPods! üíÄ


Documentation

Go to the documentation [index page](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MKGitHub/MessageBox-Concept/master/docs/index.html).
